This repository serves as a collection of modular **MATLAB scripts and functions** for various testing, simulation, and proof-of-concept projects. The goal is to provide a clean, consistent, and easily accessible environment for developing, testing, and sharing isolated MATLAB applications.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To use the code in this repository, you need to have a working installation of **MATLAB (R2018b or later recommended)**.

To clean and remove folders or delete files, the following commands may be useful:

```matlab
% Commands to clean and remove folders or delete files

if numel(dir('\DIR\PATH')) <= 2 % Set the number according to the regular amount of folders in the directory
    disp('-> DIR is clear')
else
    rmdir('\DIR\PATH','s')
    disp('-> DIR removed')
end

if isfile('\FILE\PATH.ext') == true
    delete('\FILE\PATH.ext')
    disp('-> File removed')
else
    disp('-> File not found')
end

disp('= = = = = Removing folders and files completed = = = = =')

```
