Compound interest with monthly contributions involves calculating the **future value** of an investment that includes an **initial principal** and a series of **equal, regular deposits** (an annuity). The interest is typically compounded monthly.

The total future value ($FV$) is the sum of two parts:
1.  The future value of the **initial principal** ($P$), compounded over the time period.
2.  The future value of the **monthly contributions** (annuity).

### The Formula

The full formula to calculate the future value ($FV$) of an investment with an initial principal and regular monthly contributions is:

$$FV = P{\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)}^{nt} + PMT \left[ \frac{{\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)}^{nt}-1}{\frac{r}{n}} \right]$$

### Key Variables

| Variable | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **$FV$** | The **Future Value** of the investment, including all interest earned. |
| **$P$** | The **Initial Principal** (the starting lump sum amount). |
| **$PMT$** | The amount of the **Monthly Contribution** (Payment). |
| **$r$** | The **Annual Interest Rate** (expressed as a decimal, e.g., 5% is 0.05). |
| **$n$** | The **Number of times interest is compounded per year**. For monthly compounding, $n=12$. |
| **$t$** | The **Number of years** the money is invested. |

### Components Explained

The formula is essentially two separate calculations added together:

#### 1. Future Value of the Initial Principal

$$P{\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)}^{nt}$$

This is the standard compound interest formula, which calculates how much your **initial lump sum** ($P$) will grow over time, solely from the power of compounding.

#### 2. Future Value of the Monthly Contributions (Annuity)

$$PMT \left[ \frac{{\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)}^{nt}-1}{\frac{r}{n}} \right]$$

This is the Future Value of an Ordinary Annuity formula, which calculates how much the **series of regular contributions** ($PMT$) will be worth, including all the compound interest they earn.

### The Power of Compounding with Contributions

Adding regular contributions significantly boosts the final value of your investment:

* **Principal Growth:** Each monthly contribution becomes a new piece of principal that starts earning interest immediately.
* **Interest on Interest:** The interest earned on the initial principal, the interest earned on previous contributions, and the interest earned on all other accumulated interest is continually added to the balance, accelerating the growth.
* **Time Horizon:** This effect is most powerful over **long time periods** ($t$), as the compounding has more time to multiply the gains.
